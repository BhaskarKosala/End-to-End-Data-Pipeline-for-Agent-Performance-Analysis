Data Ops Project



Objective:

Developed a simplified end-to-end data pipeline simulating a real-world operational use case to fetch, clean, transform, and report daily collection call data. The solution includes data validation, transformation, and metric generation to support performance analysis and reporting.


Scenario:

Your organization runs a daily call campaign for loan collections. You receive daily CSV dumps from multiple sources:
-	Call Logs

-	Agent Roster

-	Disposition Summary



Mock Data Files:

1.	call_logs.csv

-	Columns: call_id, agent_id, org_id, installment_id, status, duration, created_ts, call_date

-	Each row represents a single call attempt with status and duration logged.

-	Includes randomized timestamps and call statuses (completed, connected, failed, etc.).



2.	agent_roster.csv

-	Columns: agent_id, users_first_name, users_last_name, users_office_location, org_id

-	Contains static agent-level metadata like names, office location, and org ID.



3.	disposition_summary.csv

-	Columns: agent_id, org_id, call_date, login_time

-	Represents agent logins (presence) on a given date with optional login time.
 
Tasks:

1.	Data Ingestion and Validation:

-	Read all 3 files into pandas.

-	Ensure call_date, agent_id, and org_id are present and correctly formatted.

-	Flag missing or duplicate entries.



2.	Join Logic:

-	Merge the datasets using agent_id, org_id, and call_date.

-	Ensure no data loss in joins; explain how you handled mismatches.



3.	Feature Engineering:

-	For each agent on each date, compute:

*	Total Calls Made

*	Unique Loans Contacted

*	Connect Rate = Completed Calls / Total Calls

*	Avg Call Duration (in minutes)

*	Presence (1 if login_time exists, else 0)



4.	Output:

-	Save the report as agent_performance_summary.csv

-	Format a Slack-style summary message like: Agent Summary for 2025-04-28
