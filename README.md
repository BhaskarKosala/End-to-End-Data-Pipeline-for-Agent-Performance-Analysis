# End-to-End-Data-Pipeline-for-Agent-Performance-Analysis
• Built a full data pipeline to ingest, validate, and merge daily call logs, agent metadata, and login records from multiple CSV sources.
• Engineered key performance metrics (e.g., total calls, connect rate, avg. duration, agentpresence) for each agent on a daily basis.
• Ensured accurate, lossless joins on composite keys, with robust handling of missing or duplicate records.
• Generated a summary CSV report and Slack-style daily performance message for streamlined reporting.
